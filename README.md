# EltraScripts (tf2/css)

Public repo of all the vscripts I've made! Mainly contains things used on the Eltra maps on SKIAL's Tf2 "Zombie Escape" server.

Feel free to use anything here which you might find useful! Just don't expect the code to be pretty (I am NOT a trained programmer!!!).

No credits required, but a mention always feels good! :)


*NOTE: Most vscripts in this repository require the **MAPFUNC.nut** file to be placed/included somewhere within the map, and may create script errors when running without it!*
